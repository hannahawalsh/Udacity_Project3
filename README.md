Finding customer segments

This is the third project in the Udacity data scientist nanodegree. It uses unsupervised learning to find customer segments. The description from their website is:
Use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers and use those similarities to segment customers into distinct categories using various clustering techniques. This segmentation is used to help the business make more informed marketing and product decisions.

This data is from a real company and is thus private.
